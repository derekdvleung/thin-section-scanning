Standard Operating Procedure for scanning thin sections using VueScan
Last revised: 2023-05-20
Written by Chris Walli, with contributions from Derek D.V. Leung

Scanning Thin Sections With VueScan:

1. Press the on button on the front of the scanner.
2. Start the VueScan software on the computer desktop.
3. If you experience any issues either restart the software or turn on the scanner again. Also try Scanner -> Find Scanner or press F12 to detect the scanner.
4. 
   a) For non-polarized light scans, put thin section in 2.4 mm holder without any polarizers.
   b) For plane-polarized light scans, put thin section in holder and then a linear polarizer on top of the holder.
   c) For circularly polarized light scans, put bottom circular polarizer in the bottom chamber of the 2.6/2.7 mm holder, then thin section, and finally the top circular polarizer.
      Be mindful of the directions of the circular polarizers (the linear polarizer component should be on the outside, whereas the quarter wave-plate should be on the inside).
   d) For cross-polarized light scans, put a linear polarizer on the bottom chamber, then thin section, then linear polarizer on top.

5. The settings should be saved from last time the scanner was used, and would most
likely not need to be changed. If you think they have changed keep note of the
settings below.
  
For the Input Tab Set the Settings to the following:

	-Options: professional
	-Task: scan to file
	-Source: opticfilm 8200i
	-Media: image
	-Bits Per Pixel: 48 bit RGB
	-Preview Resolution: auto
	-Scan Resolution: 7200 dpi
	-Rotation: none
	-Auto Save: scan
	-Auto Print: none
	-Auto Repeat: none
	-Number of Passes: the more passes you have, the more the quality of the image goes up but
        after a while you do not notice a difference. 2 seems to work great
	-Default Folder: name the path of the folder that you want to save the image in, ex C:\users\MAC\pictures\andy-pts
	-TIFF File Name: here you set what you want the file to be named as ex: example1.tif
	Other settings that are not mentioned are to be turned off

Crop Tab Settings:

	-Crop Size: manual
	-X Size: 35.867 (Approximate size of a standard thin section. May need to adjust.)
	-Y Size: 25.947 (Approximate size of a standard thin section. May need to adjust.)
	-Auto Offset: off
	-x, y Offset: 0
	-Show Multi Outline: on
	-Lock Aspect Ratio: off
	-Border %: 0
	-Buffer%: 8
	-Preview Area: default
	-Default Options: unchecked

For filter tab nothing is set except for sharpen being set to light.

For Colour Tab:

	-Colour Balance: auto levels
	-Black point: 0%
	-White point: 0%
	-this ensures that the brightest pixels are mapped as the maximum image value and the darkest as the lowest value.

	-Brightness of Red, Green, Blue: should be set so one is near one and the red green and blue graph lines
        are close to each other
		The polarizer seems to preferentially allow red, so the blue and green values should be higher.

	-Scanner Colour Space: default
	-Printer, Output, Monitor Colour Space: all set to sRGB
	-View Colour: RGB

Output Tab:

	-Default Folder: same path to folder as in first tab
	-TIFF File: checked
	-TIFF File Name: set same as input tab like time.tif
	-TIFF Size Reduction: 1
	-TIFF Multi Page: off
	-TIFF File Type: 48 bit RGB
	-TIFF Compression: off
	-Next only TIFF profile is checked
	-Printed Size: scan size
	-Magnification: 100%
The rest after this in the output tab is not filled in except-
	-Center Captions: checked
	-Log File: on
	-Log File Max Size: 2 mb

Prefs Tab:

	-Language: Default
	-Font Size: 12
	-Both crop units and printed units:mm
	-Viewer: default
	-Auto Load Captions: on
	-Graph Type: image
	-Button Actions: not set
	-Histogram Type: linear

	-Display raw scan, Splash screen, Animate crop box, Thick crop box, Add extensions, Substitute date,
        Warn on overwrite, Warn on not ready, Warn on no scanner, Anti alias text, Anti alias image, Enable sliders,
        Enable spin buttons, Enable popup tips, Windows maximized: All checked

	-Beep When Done: 0
	-Disable Scanners: none
	-Network Scanners: mDNS
	-Calibration Period: 30
	-Image Memory: 2048
	-Window x Offset: 946
	-Window y Offset: 0
	-Window x Size: 974
	-Window y Size: 1040

6. Press preview to see what the scan is generally going to look like.
7. If you find it needs calibration you can find this under the scanner menu at the top of the program. 
(Although generally we find that the calibration button doesn't do much and can stall the scanner on occasion.)
8. Adjust RGB colours so that one colour is around one and the others are adjusted so that they line up in the histogram.
(Update: Color -> Auto levels does a good job of balancing the RGB colors.)
9. If you are satisfied, press the scan button.
10. To find your image once it is saved look in the folder that you set the default folder to be. If you forget what
the default folder is called you can find the name of the folder in the output tab of the VueScan software.
