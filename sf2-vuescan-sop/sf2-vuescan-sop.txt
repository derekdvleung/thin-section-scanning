Scanning Thin Sections With VueScan:

1. Press the on button on the front of the scanner.
2. Start the VueScan software on the computer desktop.
3. If you experience any issues either restart the software or turn on the scanner again.
4. Put a polarizer on the bottom and on the top with the thin section in the middle for cross polarized scans, and put
the glass piece on the bottom and the polarizer on the top with the thin section in the middle for the plain polarized
scans.
5. The settings should be saved from last time the scanner was used, and would most
likely not need to be changed. If you think they have changed keep note of the
settings below.

	-Auto Save: scan
	-Auto Print: none
	-Auto Repeat: none
	-Number of Passes: the more passes you have, the more the quality of the image goes up but
        after a while you do not notice a difference. 2 seems to work great

6. Press preview to see what the scan is generally going to look like.
7. If you find it needs calibration you can find this under the scanner menu at the top of the program.
8. Adjust RGB colours so that one colour is around one and the others are adjusted so that they line up in the histogram.
9. If you are satisfied, press the scan button.
10. To find your image once it is saved look in the folder that you set the default folder to be. If you forget what
the default folder is called you can find the name of the folder in the output tab of the VueScan software.
